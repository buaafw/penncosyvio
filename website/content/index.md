## Purpose

The PennCOSY VIO data set is collection of synchronized video and IMU data recorded at the University of Pennsylvania's Singh Center in April 2016. It is geared towards benchmarking of Visual Inertial Odometry algorithms on hand-held devices, but can also be used for other platforms such as micro aerial vehicles or ground robots.

## Features
What sets this benchmark apart from previous ones is that it goes from outdoors to indoors:

and provides a fairly accurate ground truth (approx 10cm) for the camera rig:
