## Compiling and using the benchmarking tools

The benchmarking tool uses the c++ and GSL library. On Ubuntu, the GSL
library can be installed via `sudo apt-get install gsl-bin
libgs10-dev`, and obviously you need the g++ compiler and `make` to be
installed. To compile the code:

```nohighlight
cd tools/cpp
make
```
This should produce (among others) the `test_trajectory` executable,
which you can use to evaluate the error of a trajectory. As an
example, here is how to use the program (`test_trajectory -h` gives
options to allow scaling etc) to test the output from Tango Bottom's
proprietary VIO algorithm. You need to download the Tango Bottom data
for that to work.

```nohighlight
./test_trajectory -r ../../data/ground_truth/af/pose.txt -t ../../data/tango_bottom/af/pose.txt
read 2885 poses from ../../data/ground_truth/af/pose.txt
read 9596 poses from ../../data/tango_bottom/af/pose.txt
*not* scaling by scale 1.1144

 3d positional error:   13.114%
```
## Visualizing results

Matlab scripts to visualize trajectories are provided in the matlab
directory. They take files as input that have pose sequences
(trajectories) in the standard format used throughout. Here is how to
visualize the Tango poses vs the ground truth in Matlab:

```
{{< highlight matlab >}}
>> cd tools/matlab
>> p1 = read_trajectory('../../data/ground_truth/as/pose.txt');
>> p2 = read_trajectory('../../data/tango_bottom/as/pose.txt');
>> view_trajectories({p1,p2}, '../misc/tags.txt');
{{< / highlight >}}
```

The result should be a picture like this:<br/>
